# Wine Quality Prediction

This Python script is designed to predict the quality of red wine based on various chemical features. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the wine into different quality categories.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: Red Wine Quality dataset
- **Data Source**: upload in git
- The dataset contains the following attributes:
  - Feature columns (11): Numerical values representing different chemical characteristics of red wine.
  - Target column: Quality rating (classification problem).

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.
- **wine_quality_prediction.py**: Python script for predicting wine quality.
- **model.pkl**: Pre-trained machine learning model for wine quality prediction.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd wine-quality-prediction


2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate


## Usage
`Clone this repository to your local machine.
`Ensure you have the pre-trained machine learning model ('model.pkl') in the same directory as the script ('wine_quality_prediction.py').
`Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
`Run the script with the appropriate arguments for the wine features you want to classify.
## For example:
    ```python wine_quality_prediction.py --fixed_acidity 7.2 --volatile_acidity 0.35 --citric_acid 0.26 --residual_sugar 10.4 --chlorides 0.045 --free_sulfur_dioxide 47.0 --total_sulfur_dioxide 186.0 --density 0.9962 --pH 3.31 --sulphates 0.64 --alcohol 9.7

## Model Training
The project uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify wine quality. The model is saved as 'model.pkl'.

## Evaluation
The script provides predictions for wine quality based on the input features.

## Results
The project outputs the predicted wine quality based on the provided chemical features.

## Future Improvements
There are several ways to enhance the model and the project:

Explore more advanced machine learning techniques.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model performance.
Gather more labeled data for improved accuracy.
